# BMI-and-Weight-Loss-Calculator
I followed a guided project about making a BMI calculator in python and added my own weight loss calculator to the project. 

Using my experience as a personal trainer I found it would be benefitial to add a weight loss calculator to this 
project. Adding a weight loss calculator will simply let someone see their body mass index then immedately be asked how much weight they would like to lose. The way I designed the calculation is so that the input is how much they want to lose, then their goal weight is calculated. I then decided to multiply the goal weight by 1%, losing at 1% of body weight per week offers the person a slow, but safe and sustainable approaach to weight loss. I then wanted to inform the person of how many weeks it will take them to reach their goal weight. 

* losing more than 1% per week can have various side effects, depending on the person. Losing weight at 2% body weight per week for me caused hair loss, constipation, and severe anxienty. This was my personal experience losing at 2% body weight. I was also only able to maintain this for 8 days before needing to change.

Things to consider when it comes to using the Body Mass Index
  1. It is for a general overview of how "healthy" someone is compared to a much larger population. For example, if you"re wanting to see how healthy or unhealthy a city, state, country is BMI is a great way to assess this.
  2. BMI does not take into account a persons body fat percentage. For example, most athletes have a high BMI but a low body fat percentage and are very physically active, and eat a nutritious diet. Yet, if they have their BMI ran they will be overweight or obese, because they will more than likely have a much higher muscle mass. 
  3. BMI also does not take into account gender. Gender is important when looking at health because males and females have different body fat percentages in regards to whats healthy. Males body fat percentages tend to get much lower than females, which need to be higher.
